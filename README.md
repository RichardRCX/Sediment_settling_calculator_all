 Overview:
 This machine learning (ML)-enabled sediment settling calculator provides a tool for resources managers to quickly estimate how far sediment can be transported downstream under predefined hydraulic conditions. 
 The model assumes sediment density of 2650 kg/m3. 
 
 Introduction:
 1. app.py is the main code to run the tool;
 2. ref_water.py and desiment_type.py are the function code be used in the app.py;
 3. requirement.txt includes the main packages need to download in your computer;
 4. Website description.docx is an introduction file to let users know the basic information and functions.
 5. Particle_single_checkpoint folder has different machine learning models for scenario 1;
 6. Particle_multiple_checkpoint folder has different machine learning models for scenario 2;
 7. static folder has the basic information for the user tool;
 8. templates folder has the basic html file.
 
 Steps to use:
 1. Download all the files from the github;
 2. Download all the packages based on the requirements.txt or pip install based on the code ;
 3. Run the app.py code and open the http://127.0.0.1:5000;
 4. Set your requirements in the user page and calculate the results.
